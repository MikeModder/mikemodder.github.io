  Hello, I'm MikeModder. My real name is Michael (surprisingly enough) and I'm just a person
  who's interesting in computers and programming. I enjoy programming little doodads including
  but not limited to: Discord bots, cool things, useless things, random things. In the past I
  have done a lot of projects in NodeJS and am currently obsessed with Golang. Have a look around,
  you might find something cool or interesting, maybe.
