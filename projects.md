[anpan](https://github.com/MikeModder/anpan): Anpan is a command framework for the [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) library. It provides an easy way to make a bot, and includes the ability to handle permission checking and restricted commands right out of the box.

[007Bot-Go](https://github.com/MikeModder/007Bot-Go): 007Bot-Go is a rewrite of my first Discord bot in Golang, using the anpan command handler.

[Wonky-Shell](https://github.com/MikeModder/Wonky-Shell): Wonky-Shell is a small shell like program (think `bash`, `zsh` or `fish`), that doesn't have much use outside of being a learning project. It has a few commands to traverse through directories and a few other simple commands (ex. `echo`).

[GoGoSSMT](https://github.com/MikeModder/GoGoSSMT): GoGoSSMT is a rewrite (making it version 4) of my "Simple Social Media Thing" (SSMT) in Golang, previously being written in NodeJS. I am currently unsure if I'm gonig to continue work on this version.

[SSMT-Reloaded](https://github.com/MikeModder/SSMT-Reloaded): SSMT-Reloaded is the third version of SSMT, which is also the latest working version. It is powered by NodeJS and MongoDB, and features email/password login, usernames, and markdown-enabled posts. You can try it out [here, runnning on a free Heroku Dyno.](https://board.ssmt.space)

[neko-server](https://github.com/MikeModder/neko-server): neko-server is a custom password server for the game `Neko Atsume: Kitty Collector` which allows the user to create custom passwords and control the amount of fish given upon entering them.


These are not all of the things that I have worked on, and more can be found [on my GitHub profile](https://github.com/MikeModder), if you're interesting in the other (in my opinion, less interesting) things.
