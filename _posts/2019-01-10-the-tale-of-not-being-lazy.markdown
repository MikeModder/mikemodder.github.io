Hello and welcome to my blog! Previously this site served as *just* a landing page for my GitHub profile, and was essentially abandoned for a while. That is, until now! Swooping in with my newly found powers of Jekyll, I have revived this and turned it into a blog, as well as a landing page.

The current design is subject to change, and it'll probably get changed in the future when I find a cool theme to use.
